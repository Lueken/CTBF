                <h2>Raising Our Helping Hand</h2>
                <p class="story-intro">Created To Be Free Mentoring exists because we recognize and are deeply concerned about the pandemic nature of sex and pornography addiction and human trafficking. Our ministry was born not from theory, but from lived experience and a divine calling to help others find the freedom that only Christ can provide.</p>

                        <h3>Why We Do This Work</h3>
                        <p>We've witnessed firsthand the devastating impact these addictions have on individuals, marriages, and families. What started as a personal journey of recovery has grown into a global ministry reaching those who desperately need hope and healing. We understand the shame, the isolation, and the feeling that freedom is impossible‚Äîbecause we've been there.</p>

                        <h3>Our Heart for the World</h3>
                        <p>Using a Biblically-based, trauma and clinically-informed approach, we strive to offer the best, most contemporary mentoring services to men, women, and families both locally and worldwide. Whether through in-person meetings or electronic sessions, we meet people where they are in their journey to freedom. To date, we've served men and families in 10 countries around the world‚Äîwith God's help and your support, we will continue to reach more.</p>

                        <h3>Equipping Communities</h3>
                        <p>In addition to working directly with those struggling with addiction and their families, we are dedicated to helping churches and civic organizations reach out to their local communities. We believe in educating and equipping them to offer a path to freedom from addiction to those living in their own neighborhoods. Recovery happens in community, and we're committed to building that community wherever we go.</p>

                        <h3>Accessibility & Compassion</h3>
                        <p>Because we are a faith-based, 501(c)(3) non-profit ministry, as often as possible we use a sliding fee scale for groups, 1-on-1 mentoring, speaking, and training. We believe that every person with the heart, desire, and courage to pursue freedom from sexual addiction should have the opportunity‚Äîand finances should not prevent that pursuit.</p>

It is important that we maximize the benefit of your contributions for the men, marriages, and families that need it most. Every dollar donated goes directly toward helping someone find freedom.</p>

We've seen God work miracles in the lives of those who thought freedom was impossible. Through your partnership, we can reach even more people with the message that freedom is not only possible‚Äîit's promised in Christ.</p>
