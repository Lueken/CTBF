                        <p>On August 28, 2015, the husband of the woman with whom I was currently committing adultery met Lynn in our driveway and presented her with copies of texts and emails proving that what he was telling her was true.</p>

                        <p>The very thought was devastating and overwhelming for her, but like an iceberg, she was seeing only the smallest, visible part of my addiction to pornography, adult chat rooms, dating sites, Craig's List, and adulteries.</p>

                        <p><strong>Adulteries. Plural. Numerous.</strong></p>

                        <p>I had been medicating my traumas, hurts, and fears since I was eight years old—a lifetime of addiction and perversion. I wish I could say I had the courage to "man up" and confess my sexual addiction, but the truth wasn't in me. It required a crisis to set me on the path of reality and redemption.</p>

                        <p>She never screamed at me, threw anything, or struck out at me. She never lost her Godly grace. She pulled no punches and spoke the whole truth. She didn't sugar-coat anything and said exactly what was on her heart.</p>

                        <p>After I confessed to our children, one of our daughters-in-law sent me a book recommended by one of her friends. It was called "Pure Desire." I immediately poured through it as I was looking for any way to get my life out of the pit I'd lived in for so long.</p>

                        <p>The book gave me hope—not for salvaging our marriage as I knew that was gone—but the hope of a real Father to heal the Father-hole in my heart.</p>

                        <p>During Lynn's weekend away in October 2015, she looked up every Bible verse having to do with divorce and asked God to guide her in her decisions. Then, she read "Pure Desire." For the first time since I was "found out," she saw a glimmer of hope for us.</p>

                        <p>We talked about our future. We still had (have) a lot of work to do. Was I willing to do it? Could I remain pure and live a life of sexual integrity? Did we want to stay together and fight for the marriage I tried so hard to destroy?</p>

                        <p><strong>We said "no" to rebuilding our marriage. We buried it that day.</strong> I had maimed the old marriage beyond saving. We chose that day not to rebuild a marriage built on lies, but rather to create a new marriage built on the foundation God intended.</p>
